    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    const team2 = players.slice();

    const team3 = [...players];

    const team4 = Array.from(players);
    const team5 = [].concat(players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'captain',
        age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99 //this will change person to include person.number = 99 as well

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 } )

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const tim = {
        name: 'tim',
        age: 29,
        social: {
            twitter: '@tgaribal',
            facebook: 'www.facebook.com/tgaribal'
        }
    }

    const tim2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 30 });

    //note that the social is still a reference here, NOT a nwe object, and so updating tim2.social.twitter 
    //will also change tim.social.twitter...they refer to the same object!

    //you can use deepclone functions, usually you can find them online (or write your own!), or use the poor 
    //mans deep clone:
    const tim3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(tim));
